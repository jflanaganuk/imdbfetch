- Add swipe gestures to navigate
- Tidy up settings pane (make it easier and more obvious how to close etc.)
- Investigate extra stuff we can do now we have migrated to tmdb!!
    - TV Shows?
    - Search?
- Investigate if we could host the app through node like how CacheMeIfYouCan is working (using same principles)?
    - Would make a lot of things easier going forward, routing etc.
