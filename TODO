- Investigate extra stuff we can do now we have migrated to tmdb!!
    - actor pages etc.

- Add lists
    - lists need to be made in a different way  (seperate component to fetch)
        - add the list as a query param?
    - this should then allow easy additions of other list types
    - tidy up proper list page

- Revisit Settings (change to api key method?)

- Desktop CSS needs reworking, add a limiter to horizontal width and increase content on page (so scrolling returns)
    - Left and right arrows seem odd on desktop currently
- Add maintenance page?
- Investigate /public on apache (eg. package.json visible)

- Rename Imdbfetch to lofat throughout code
