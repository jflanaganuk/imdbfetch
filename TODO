- fix actor scroll with left and right buttons (it can desync from the normal scroll behaviour on touch devices)
- fix the iframe scrollbar on some trailers
- enhance the radarr integration flow, so far you only get one attempt
- add "side" buttons for mobile/small screens only
- increase perf by splitting bundles
- Server side might be better to work what day it is ran on and start the weekly countdown from a monday so we know new data is fully available?
